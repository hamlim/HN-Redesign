# HN-Redesign
A weekend project (trying) to redesign HN


## Why?

A few days ago I stumbled upon [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/33841588/Hacker-News-Redesign) Behance image of a redesign concept for HN, and figured I would
want to test my css skills (and also maybe learn sass in the process).

I noticed that the design shared several key similarities to [designernews.co](https://designernews.co) so I started off by looking at some of the html behind that site
to get a good understanding of what some of the tricks I could employ to design this.
