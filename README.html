<p>A weekend project (trying) to redesign HN</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>A few days ago I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/33841588/Hacker-News-Redesign">this</a> Behance image of a redesign concept for HN, and figured I would
want to test my css skills (and also maybe learn sass in the process).</p>

<p>I noticed that the design shared several key similarities to <a href="https://designernews.co">designernews.co</a> so I started off by looking at some of the html behind that site
to get a good understanding of what some of the tricks I could employ to design this.</p>

<p>[] - Render score and upvote button
[] - Render the number of the items</p>
